 A utility to copy large amounts of files quickly though threading

# Usage
 mClone "C:\Users\Test\TestFolder" "F:\TestFolderCopy" 500

 It may be tempting to crank the Threads number as high as you want but this could crash your system or make it unstable if you
 run it at high threading count as thats how many SIMULTANIUS files that can be copyed
